# Hello, I'm Norma Berrones - A Software Engineer in transition!

As I transition into the world of software development, I'm excited to bring my passion for technology and my experience from Tech Elevator to build impactful, scalable systems. I’m committed to continuous learning and applying my growing technical skillset to collaborate on innovative projects.


# My Tech Journey
I’ve developed a solid foundation in software engineering, with hands-on experience in the following areas:

Languages & Frameworks:
Java | JavaScript | HTML | CSS | Vue.js | Spring Boot

Databases:
PostgreSQL | SQL | JDBC

Development Practices:
Agile methodologies | Integration Testing | Unit Testing (JUnit)

Tools & Environments:
Git | IntelliJ | AWS | Docker (currently learning)

Design & Architecture:
E/R Diagrams | Table Design | SOLID Principles

I am passionate about writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code that scales. My goal is to collaborate with like-minded individuals and teams to create systems that deliver real value.


# Continuous Learning & Growth
As a software engineer, I am always learning and evolving. Here are some key areas I’m currently diving deeper into.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Strengthening my understanding of OOP to create more modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

SOLID Principles: Applying these principles to improve the design of my applications, making them more scalable and easier to manage.

AWS (Amazon Web Services): Gaining hands-on experience with cloud services to deploy, manage, and scale applications in the cloud.

Microservices Architecture: Learning how to build distributed, fault-tolerant systems using microservices to support scalability and flexibility.

Test-Driven Development (TDD): Embracing TDD to write better tests and ensure the reliability and quality of my code.


# Leadership & Engineering Blend
My background extends beyond coding—I bring leadership experience from previous roles where I mentored teams, strategized systems implementation, and fostered collaboration. This unique blend of technical expertise and leadership skills allows me to approach problem-solving with a holistic, user-centric perspective.

I’ve built a career focused on empowering teams through systems that promote competence, collaboration, and accountability. Now, as a software engineer, I’m eager to leverage my leadership experience to contribute to agile, forward-thinking teams that prioritize both technical excellence and user experience.
